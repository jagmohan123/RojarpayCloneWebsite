# Features
Responsive Design: The clone website is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes.
Pure HTML & Tailwind CSS: The project is built solely using HTML and CSS, making it beginner-friendly and easy to understand.
Customizable: Developers can easily modify the code to experiment with different styles, layouts, and components.
Static Website: Since it's a static website, it doesn't require any backend or server setup, making it suitable for hosting on platforms like GitHub Pages.
 I made the Razorpay website landing page cloning by using the concept of the tailwind css.
  I used the concept of only HTML tags CSS, and tailwind css such as margin, padding, flex, grid animations and orders, and basic css properties.
